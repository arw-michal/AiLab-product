Use cases
Last updated: Nov 21, 2024
When you implement the watsonx.ai and watsonx.governance use cases, you can solve the challenges of building machine learning models and generative AI, governing AI, and managing your AI lifecycles.

The use cases in IBM watsonx as a Service provide these main capabilities for managing and automating your AI lifecycles:

Collaborative innovation
Collaborate with others to discover insights. Prepare data, analyze data, and build models with a set of integrated tools for all levels of experience.

Governance and compliance
Track and document the detailed history of AI models to help ensure compliance.

Unified lifecycle
Automate the building, testing, deploying, and monitoring of AI models.

You can start with a use case and add another one as you need it. Explore each use case to learn about what you can accomplish and the tools you can use.

Watsonx.ai
Transform your business processes with AI-driven solutions by integrating machine learning and generative AI into your operational framework. Watsonx.ai provides the processes and technologies to enable your enterprise to develop and deploy machine learning models and generative AI solutions.

Services for this use case: watsonx.ai Studio and watsonx.ai Runtime
