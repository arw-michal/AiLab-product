Comparison of IBM watsonx as a Service and Cloud Pak for Data as a Service
Last updated: Nov 21, 2024
IBM watsonx as a Service and Cloud Pak for Data as a Service have the same common core functionality and are compatible in many ways. The watsonx platform provides a subset of the tools and services that are provided by Cloud Pak for Data as a Service. However, watsonx.ai and watsonx.governance on watsonx provide more functionality than the same set of tools on Cloud Pak for Data as a Service.

Common platform functionality
Services on each platform
Data science and MLOps tools
AI governance tools
Common core functionality
The common core functionality is the same on watsonx and Cloud Pak for Data as a Service:

Security, compliance, and isolation
Compute resources for running workloads
Global search for assets across the platform
The Platform assets catalog for sharing connections across the platform
Role-based user management within workspaces
A services catalog for adding services
View compute usage from the Administration menu
Connections to remote data sources
Connection credentials that are personal or shared
Sample assets and projects
If you are signed up for both watsonx and Cloud Pak for Data as a Service, you can switch between platforms. See Switching your platform.

Services on each platform
Both platforms provide services for data science and MLOps and AI governance use cases:

watsonx.ai Studio
watsonx.ai Runtime
watsonx.governance
However, the services for watsonx.ai and watsonx.governance on the watsonx platform include features for working with foundation models and generative AI that are not included in these services on Cloud Pak for Data as a Service.

Cloud Pak for Data as a Service also provides services for these use cases:

Data integration
Data governance
See IBM Cloud services in the Cloud Pak for Data as a Service services catalog.

Data science and AI tools
Both platforms provide a common set of data science and AI tools. However, on watsonx, you can also perform foundation model inferencing with the Prompt Lab tool or with a Python library in notebooks. Foundation model inferencing and the Prompt Lab tool are not available on Cloud Pak for Data as a Service.

The following table shows which data science and AI tools are available on each platform.
